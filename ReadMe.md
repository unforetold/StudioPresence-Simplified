## **Firstly, Requirements.**



**Make sure you have a recent version of Python installed. Anything in the last year should work (if you have any issues, just update it)**



**Then,** open a terminal and CD into this extracted folder.



**And run:**

(might depend on your python installation)



pip install -r requirements.txt



**OR IF THAT DOESNT WORK**



python3 pip install -r requirements.txt

python pip install -r requirements.txt



## **Secondly, Setup**



There is one script that needs to be setup.



quickstart.vbs. Right click on it and "Edit in notepad"



There are two variables we need to edit.



First: the python path. This should work for most people, just change where it says "natha" to your local username, (if you aren't sure open a terminal and run whoami - it'll be the second half of the output (after the slash) 



My output was: wheel/mazmc, meaning my username is mazmc.



Then, we need to edit **scriptPath** - change the directory to be where you have extracted the folder:



e.g. folderpath/main.py. 



**MAKE SURE IT HAS main.py at the end or it will not work.**



Then, copy that one script into these two folders:



C:\\Users\\{username}\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\StartupS **(*basically starts right as you log in)***



C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu (***for if you accidently quit the program)***



## **Thirdly, Start it!**



That should be everything. Make sure you have the roblox extension installed and you are good to go.
